# GARCH-Filtered Volatility Forecasting with Machine Learning (XGBoost)

## Overview

This project implements a **hybrid volatility forecasting framework** for 24-hour electricity futures in the **Germany–France (DE–FR) coupled power market**.

The approach combines:

1. **Rolling GARCH(1,1)** to model systematic volatility dynamics  
2. **XGBoost** to forecast residual volatility  
3. **Rank-based validation and trading implementation**

The objective is **relative ranking of volatility (cross-sectional signal extraction)** rather than precise level prediction.

> This is a research-grade project and work in progress.

## Data

- Source: ENS machine learning challenge  
  https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/97/
- Only **TRAIN data** is used
- A **rolling forecasting setup** is implemented
- Full realized volatility is available for evaluation
- No challenge TEST data is used
- The original challenge focused on price explanation, not forecasting

Due to potential restrictions, the dataset is not included in the repository.

---

## Objective & Evaluation

### Primary Metric
- **Spearman rank correlation (Information Coefficient)**

The model is evaluated on its ability to correctly rank relative volatility between DE and FR.

### Validation Layers
- Statistical validation (rank IC, stability checks)
- Economic validation (market-neutral trading strategy with transaction costs)

---

## Model Architecture

### 1. GARCH Baseline

For each country:

- Rolling **GARCH(1,1)** model
- 500-day estimation window
- One-step-ahead volatility forecast
- Models estimated independently for DE and FR

Purpose:
- Capture autoregressive volatility structure
- Remove common dynamics before ML step

---

### 2. ML on Residual Volatility

Machine learning is applied to **GARCH residual volatility**.

- Model: **XGBoost**
- Rolling training window: 280 days  
- Prediction horizon: 21 days  
- Empirical hyperparameter selection

Why XGBoost:
- Captures nonlinear regime effects
- Handles threshold behavior typical in power markets
- Robust to small, noisy datasets (with regularization)

---

### 3. Feature Engineering

Features are designed to reflect structural system regimes.

**Volatility persistence**
- Lagged volatility
- Rolling volatility statistics

**System stress**
- Residual load measures
- Stress indicators

**Cross-border congestion**
- Flow imbalance variables

**Fuel & merit order**
- Gas–coal spreads
- Carbon pressure proxies

**Renewables regime**
- Relative renewable penetration

Feature selection to be used for training is now automatic and is not perfect. Might adjust it later.

Key observation:
> Structural regime variables dominate predictive power. Many exogenous effects are absorbed by lagged volatility and stress indicators.

All features are constructed to avoid forward-looking bias.

## Results (In-Sample Rolling Backtest)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Pooled IC (ML residual) | 0.32 |
| DE IC (ML residual) | 0.12 |
| FR IC (ML residual) | 0.18 |
| DE IC (GARCH baseline) | 0.08 |
| FR IC (GARCH baseline) | 0.07 |
| Strategy Sharpe (with costs) | 0.8 |
| Max Drawdown | -13.8% |

Interpretation:
- ML improves upon a weak GARCH baseline
- Predictive power is moderate but persistent
- Results are economically exploitable

---

## Trading Framework

Signals are converted into a **relative volatility spread strategy**:

- Cross-sectional normalization
- Rolling z-scores
- Threshold-based entry rules
- Hypothetical transaction costs included
- Market-neutral across DE–FR

The strategy targets **relative volatility mispricing**, not a directional bet.

### Trading Results (With Costs)

| Metric               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| Sharpe Ratio         | 0.8   |
| Max Drawdown         |-13.8  |
| Avg Daily Turnover   | 0.48  |

# Limitations

This project has important constraints:

### 1. Small dataset
- Limited time span
- Low number of independent regimes
- Risk of overfitting despite rolling validation
- Results may not generalize to new structural regimes

### 2. Simple baseline
- GARCH(1,1) is a simple benchmark and has quite a weak signal level here
- Incremental ML improvement should be interpreted cautiously

### 3. Trading assumptions
- Simplified execution model
- No liquidity constraints
- No slippage modeling
- Capacity limits not considered

---

## Next Steps

- Stronger volatility benchmarks (HAR, regime-switching models)
- Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
- External dataset validation
- More realistic execution modeling

---

## Takeaway

This project demonstrates:

- A structured approach to hybrid volatility modeling  
- Rank-based evaluation aligned with trading applications  
- Integration of statistical validation and trading backtesting  

It should be viewed as a **research prototype**, not a production-ready trading system.
